# Understanding and maintaining a sustainable diet
Maintaining a sustainable diet as outlined by EAT

## Purpose
We are peppered with information on the benefits of a balanced diet and, assuming that we have sufficient displosable income, have a number of ways to satisfy this need and apps that will help us track this.  We are also aware of the environmental pressures that our plantet is under due to consumer behaviour ranging from commuting, flights, food packaging, home energy usage, responsible investing ... the list is seemingly endless, and balancing our own impact on the environment is at times a daunting task.  Potential "quick fixes" such as carbon-offsetting also has a debatable impact, so what can we do?

This project will focus on one aspect of this challenge: diet and sustainability.

Using data published in the Lancet within the [Food in the Anthropocene: the EATâ€“Lancet Commission on healthy diets from sustainable food systems](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31788-4/fulltext?utm_campaign=tleat19) article as a baseline for consumption, the aim is to provide a utility that will help people plan meals over variable time horizons that will meet this.

## Objectives and challenges

* Allow for changes to the baseline usage such as exercise and bodyweight - _Can we use a simple multiplier on the aggregate consumption numbers without significant environmental impact?_
* Allow for allergies/dislikes both individually identified and by category e.g. FODMAP and IBS
* Allow for a variable time horizon for balance: weekly vs. monthly
* Allow for a spending cap to account for food budget - _How can we best source pricing information?_
* Allow for a variety of recipe suggestions over a period as a change needs to hold people's attention to be effective - _randomisation, increased volume of recipes, classification of ingredients, nutrition and other ingredient attributes_
